              <p>Sandy (30) and Kato (3) live in Troy, NY. Sandy is seeking a male 27-35 who loves the outdoors,
                cycling, hiking, and going to the beach. This eligible male should own a small to medium sized pooch
                who is energetic and playful. When Sandy and Kato are not hiking trails in the Adirondacks, they could
                be biking on Rt 2 heading toward Grafton Park. They also like going to Grafton Lake in the summer
                to swim and fetch (Kato does the fetching).</p>

              <p>Marcia (28) and Mandy (4) live in Schenectady, NY. They can be found most weekends enjoying
                the Mohawk Bike Path. They are seeking an adventourous 28-33 year old male with a fearless dog. The dog
                should be
                small to medium sized and be comfortable with kids. Sometimes Marcia bikes while Mandy trots
                alongside; sometimes they both walk at a brisk pace. Either way, they love the sunshine and meeting
                other dog parents with their four-legged friends.
